# DCGAN and Improved WGAN

Project referenced from Udacity's [face_generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/face_generation) wich is part of their [deep-learning](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning) course. Further implementations have been done for DCGAN and Improved WGAN with techniques to improve training speed.

### Prerequisites

- Jupyter notebook
- Tensoflow 
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Getting Started

1. `git clone ` + repo URL
2. cd to repo
3. `pip install -r requirement.txt` if packages are not yet installed
4. `jupyter notebook ` + jupyter notebook selected

## Results
